# Kyrie - Discord Bot Application

This repository contains the code for a discord bot I manage in my free time.
Currently, this bot is not public and cannot be invited to discord servers.

Upon alpha release, the bot will have the following features:
 - Mod Assistance
 - User Leveling
 - MEE6 Migration
 - TicTacToe :D

Some planned features and ideas are:
 - Auto Moderation
 - Server-Specific Memes
 - Global Memes
 - Global Leveling (Across servers the bot is in)
 - Automatic Roles
 - Role Selectors
